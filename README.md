# Turtini Labs

Hands-on practice labs for Red Hat certifications and real-world system administration.

## Tracks

- **RHCSA**: `./rhcsa/`
- **RHCE**: `./rhce/` (in progress)

## Philosophy

These labs are designed to be **studied and practiced**, not executed as automation.
They emphasize minimal changes, persistent state, and disciplined verification.
