# OpenShift Administration Practice Labs (EX280)

Hands-on, exam-aligned practice labs for the **Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration (EX280)** exam.

These labs are designed to build *operational fluency* with OpenShift — not just conceptual familiarity. The focus is on real cluster interaction, correct sequencing, verification habits, and exam-style problem solving.

---

## Goals

- Build confidence working directly with OpenShift clusters
- Develop muscle memory with `oc` commands
- Practice troubleshooting under time pressure
- Prepare for the **hands-on EX280 exam format**

---

## Philosophy

These labs are meant to be:

- **Typed and practiced**, not blindly copy/pasted
- **Verified continuously**, not assumed correct
- **Minimal but realistic**, matching exam constraints
- **Vendor-aligned**, using OpenShift-native workflows

This is **not** a shortcut repo, brain dump, or answer key.

---


Each lab directory typically includes:

- `README.md` — scenario and objectives
- `commands.md` — guided command walkthrough
- `verification.md` — how to confirm success

---

## How to Use These Labs

1. Work **one lab at a time**, in order
2. Type commands manually whenever possible
3. Verify after *every* major step
4. Break things intentionally — then fix them
5. Re-run labs until actions feel automatic

---

## Mock Exam

A full mock exam is included to simulate real EX280 conditions:

- Mixed objectives
- Time-boxed execution
- Partial credit scoring
- Verification-based grading

Treat it like the real exam.
