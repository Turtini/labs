# OpenShift Administration Practice Labs (EX280)

Hands-on, exam-aligned practice labs for the **Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration (EX280)** exam.

These labs are designed to build *operational fluency* with OpenShift — not just conceptual familiarity. The focus is on real cluster interaction, correct sequencing, verification habits, and exam-style problem solving.

---

## Goals

- Build confidence working directly with OpenShift clusters
- Develop muscle memory with `oc` commands
- Practice troubleshooting under time pressure
- Prepare for the **hands-on EX280 exam format**

---

## Philosophy

These labs are meant to be:

- **Typed and practiced**, not blindly copy/pasted
- **Verified continuously**, not assumed correct
- **Minimal but realistic**, matching exam constraints
- **Vendor-aligned**, using OpenShift-native workflows

This is **not** a shortcut repo, brain dump, or answer key.
