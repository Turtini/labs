# Red Hat OpenShift Administration I Practice Labs (DO180)

Hands-on practice labs aligned to **Red Hat OpenShift Administration I (DO180)**. These labs have been used by public sector practitioners as part of hands-on preparation for Red Hat OpenShift Administration (DO180) and related OpenShift operational work. 

They focus on foundational OpenShift skills using the `oc` CLI and OpenShift-native workflows.

This track is designed to build **confidence, correctness, and operational awareness** before progressing to advanced administration or exam-focused tracks such as EX280.

---

## Goals

- Build comfort working with OpenShift clusters via the `oc` CLI
- Understand core OpenShift concepts: projects, applications, builds, and networking
- Develop strong context and verification habits
- Prepare for real-world OpenShift usage and follow-on certification paths

---

## Philosophy

These labs are meant to be:

- **Typed and practiced**, not blindly copy/pasted
- **Verified continuously**, not assumed correct
- **Incremental and realistic**, matching how OpenShift is used in practice
- **Vendor-aligned**, using OpenShift-native tools and terminology

This is not a shortcut repo, answer key, or brain dump.

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to an OpenShift cluster (training, lab, or shared environment)
- Valid user credentials or login token
- The `oc` CLI installed on your workstation
- Basic familiarity with Linux command-line usage

---

## Lab Structure

Each lab directory contains:

- `README.md` – Conceptual overview, objectives, and tasks
- `commands.md` – Command reference and hands-on practice (added after all READMEs)

Labs should be completed **in order**.

---

## Labs

- **Lab 01** – Cluster Access and the `oc` CLI  
- **Lab 02** – Projects, Users, and Basic Access Control  
- **Lab 03** – Applications and Builds  
- **Lab 04** – ConfigMaps and Secrets  
- **Lab 05** – Storage and Persistence  
- **Lab 06** – Networking and Routes  
- **Lab 07** – Troubleshooting and Debugging  
- **Lab 08** – Security Contexts and SCCs  

---

## How to Use This Track

1. Read the lab `README.md` fully before running commands
2. Perform tasks using the `oc` CLI
3. Verify results after each step
4. Do not skip verification steps
5. Move on only when concepts are clear

Accuracy matters more than speed.

---

## Next Steps

After completing DO180 labs, learners should be prepared to:

- Operate confidently in OpenShift projects
- Understand application lifecycle basics
- Transition into **EX280 OpenShift Administration** preparation

---

Happy clustering.
