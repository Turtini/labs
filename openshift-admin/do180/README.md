# OpenShift Administration I Practice Labs (DO180)

Hands-on, concept-driven practice labs aligned with **Red Hat OpenShift Administration I (DO180)**.

This track is designed for engineers who are new to OpenShift or Kubernetes and want to build **real operational confidence** before moving on to advanced administration or the EX280 exam.

These labs emphasize *doing*, *verifying*, and *understanding* — not memorization.

---

## Who This Track Is For

- Engineers new to OpenShift or containers
- Linux admins transitioning into Kubernetes
- Developers who want to understand how OpenShift actually works
- Anyone preparing for DO180 or moving toward EX280

---

## Goals

By completing this track, you will:

- Understand core OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts
- Interact confidently with OpenShift using the `oc` CLI
- Deploy and troubleshoot containerized applications
- Learn how OpenShift builds on Kubernetes primitives
- Develop good verification and debugging habits early

---

## Philosophy

These labs are meant to be:

- **Hands-on first**, not slide-driven
- **Typed and practiced**, not blindly copy/pasted
- **Verified continuously**, not assumed correct
- **Concept-aware**, explaining *why* when it matters
- **EX280-aligned**, building skills that carry forward

This is not an answer key or shortcut repo.

---

## Lab Structure

Each lab directory includes:

- `README.md` — objectives, context, and tasks
- `commands.md` — CLI commands you should practice typing and understanding

---

## Recommended Lab Order

1. Getting Started with OpenShift and the CLI
2. Containers, Images, and Pods
3. Applications and Kubernetes Objects
4. Basic Troubleshooting and Debugging

Complete this track before moving on to **EX280 OpenShift Administration Labs**.

---

## Next Steps

- After DO180 → move to `openshift-admin/ex280`
- Use EX280 labs for timed, exam-style practice

Happy clustering. 🚀
