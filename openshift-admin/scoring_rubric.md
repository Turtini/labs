# EX280 Timed Mock Exam — Scoring Rubric

This rubric is used to evaluate the **OpenShift Administration (EX280) Timed Mock Exam**.

Scoring is **outcome-based**, closely mirroring how Red Hat practical exams are graded.

The goal is not perfect code or elegance — the goal is **correct, verifiable results** produced under time constraints.

## Total Score: 100 Points  
**Recommended Passing Score: 70–75**

Partial credit is intentionally available.

## Scoring Philosophy

Points are awarded based on **observable outcomes**, not intent.

- If a resource exists, is correctly named, and behaves as required → points awarded
- If a resource is partially correct → partial credit may apply
- If work cannot be verified → no credit is awarded

Verification matters as much as configuration.

Each section defines:
- What is being evaluated
- How many points are available

Score honestly. The value is in identifying gaps.
